# Django ORM standalone

This boilerplate is available for you to use the amazing Django ORM in your projects with python.

If you want, you can of course use all the the framework offers to you, but in my case, i did this because i needed only the ORM.

What you will need is to install Pipenv, create a new environment, and install its dependencies.

After that, all commands of Django will be available for you, including nice django management commands.

## Observations:
In `settings.py` you have a config (`SECRET_KEY`) that is empty.
There, in the file i let a command that you should execute in your terminal, and paste the result in the value of this variable.
